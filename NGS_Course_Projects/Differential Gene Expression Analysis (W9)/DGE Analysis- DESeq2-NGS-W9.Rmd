The count matrices for this analysis were downloaded from the NYU HPC and saved in a local folder titled source_files in this same working directory. 
```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```


```{r}

sampleCondition <- c(rep('highSucrose',4),rep('lowSucrose',4))

                          fileName = sampleFiles,
